# monster-ui-numbers-regextern
external number of providers integration in monster-ui

this is for internal use only, to integration with other services

THIS IS BETA_CODE IT WORKS BUT WAIT UNIT IS VERSION 1, THEN INTEGRATION FINISHED WITH MONSTER-UI

1. INSTALL kazoo-platform
2. INSTALL monster-ui (from this repository because of adds in ui)
3. INSTALL THIS in a subfolder where one of kazoo-freeswitch is AND ADD php-cli support there
4. FOLLOW the instruction on 2600hz-dev on google-groups to allow ONLY! calls from your providers

If you have more ideas let me known on this github repository
